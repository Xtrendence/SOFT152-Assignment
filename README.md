# SOFT152-Assignment

SOFT152 Coursework by Khodadad (Adrian) Nouchin.
 
This was created after I had already made the UI of the program. It looked a bit too professional in a way, and I was worried the teacher would think I cheated or copy-pasted all the code. Hopefully a private GitHub repository (so it doesn't get flagged for plagiarism or something) will be enough to prove I coded it all myself. After 3 years of daily full stack web development (with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS, PHP) and, on multiple occasions, Android app development (with Java), I should know my way around UI design and programming in general... Kind of at least, perhaps not as well as an actual professional.
