# SOFT152 Assignment (Airbnb Management Tool)

SOFT152 Coursework by Khodadad (Adrian) Nouchin.
 
This was created after I had already made the UI of the program. It looked a bit too professional in a way, and I was worried the teacher would think I cheated or copy-pasted all the code, especially because I finished about 80% of the project within the first day or two. Hopefully a private GitHub repository (so it doesn't get flagged for plagiarism or something) will be enough to prove I coded it myself.

Please note that the only reason I managed to learn and do it all so quickly is due to 3 years of daily full stack web development (with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS, PHP) and, on multiple occasions, Android app development (with Java).

The bread is royalty and copyright free, I made sure of it.
